<h1>Just a news website<h1/>

Basically i just used it for learning how to do something be a little bit responsive, i used JS and media-querry concepts, 
all very simple, i m learning so yeah thats good to have this here in case i lost it on my computer or just delete lol

I made it for use in one of my classes at university, if you want to clone it feel free, (it is not a finished website btw)
